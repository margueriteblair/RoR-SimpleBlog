# Ruby On Rails - SimpleBlog

As the title states, this application is meant to simulate a social media site where a user can make blog posts, and other users can leave comments. This is a very basic Ruby application to help me get a hang of how data can be sent and manipulated in Ruby on Rails.

This simple application makes use of:

* Ruby

* Rails framework

* Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern

* Rails generators

* Database creation

* Database migration

* Bootstrap styling
